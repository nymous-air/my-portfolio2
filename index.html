    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Khanyisizwe Airborne Mdluli</strong>, an emerging visual artist from eSwatini. My journey with art began in grade school, where I often found myself sketching and doodling between lessons. What began as a playful pastime gradually developed into a deeper artistic pursuit as I became more aware of the power of creative expression.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        My practice is strongly informed by the legacies of <em>Jean-Michel Basquiat</em>, whose chaotic brilliance revealed the raw possibilities of visual storytelling; <em>Cy Twombly</em>, whose contemporary works challenged the boundaries of form and language; and <em>Amoako Boafo</em>, whose textured brushwork and celebration of identity within the African diaspora continue to inspire me. I also draw inspiration from the broader <strong>Afrofuturism movement</strong>, which reimagines Black identity, history, and futures through speculative and innovative aesthetics.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Through my work, I seek to explore the intersections of memory, identity, and cultural imagination, blending the spontaneity of expression with an academic appreciation of artistic traditions. My style reflects both personal introspection and a dialogue with global movements that position African creativity at the forefront of contemporary art. <span class="highlight">Welcome to my portfolio.</span>
